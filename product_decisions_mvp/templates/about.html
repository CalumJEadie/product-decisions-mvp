    <h1>Who are we?</h1>
  </div>


  	<p>21 Spokes was started by Calum and Andrew. They were helping a couple of friends choose bikes and ended up bombarding them with link after link of interesting finds from eBay. They were trawling through pages of listings to find second-hand gems  to recommend.</p>

  	<p>With a few happy friends now cycling, they want to help others discover used bikes with a bit of character and personality. They're usually cheaper too. So this is our first attempt at bringing friendly recommendations to the masses. 
	</p>

	<p>You can reach the team at xxxxxx@gmail.com. We love helping customers find the perfect bike or going for coffee.
